# 🌙 Moon River - A Period Data Pool for Better Women's Health

Moon River is a Data Liquidity Pool (DLP) built on Vana, a layer-one blockchain designed for the trustless and secure exchange of user-owned data.

### 🤔 Problem

Women's health—especially menstrual health—hasn't been properly studied. There's not enough good quality data about periods, symptoms, and related health issues. This makes it harder to create better treatments and tools for women's health.

### 💡 Our Solution

We create a safe, private, and rewarding space where women can share their period-related data (e.g. tracking symptoms, cycle patterns, or birth control side effects). This data helps researchers and AI companies create better models, tools and treatments for menstrual health, and contributors get paid every time their data is used.

## 🚀 How It Works

### 📱 You Share Your Data Safely

- Use your period-tracking app (like Flo or Clue) to export your data
- Upload it to MoonRiver website through a secure portal
- Your data is encrypted and anonymous—no one can trace it back to you.

### 🔒 We Check and Protect Your Data

- Your data is double-checked for accuracy and uniqueness by Validators using TEE
- A special process makes sure your data hasn't been tampered with

### 🔬 Your Data Helps Research

- Once your data is approved, it goes into a pool that researchers and companies can access
- They pay to use the data.

### 💰 You Get Paid

- Every time someone uses your data, you earn rewards in Moonlight (MOON) tokens
- You can trade, use, or save them.
