# 🌙 Moon River - A Period Data Liquidity Pool for Better Women's Health

Moon River is a Data Liquidity Pool (DLP) built on Vana, a layer-one blockchain designed for the trustless and secure exchange of user-owned data.

### 🤔 Problem

Women's health—especially menstrual health—hasn't been properly studied. There's not enough good quality data about periods, symptoms, and related health issues. This makes it harder to create better treatments and tools for women's health.

### 💡 Our Solution

We create a safe, private, and rewarding space where women can share their period-related data (e.g. tracking symptoms, cycle patterns, or birth control side effects). This data helps researchers and AI companies create better models, tools and treatments for menstrual health, and contributors get paid every time their data is used.

## 🚀 How It Works

### 📱 You Share Your Data Safely

- Use your period-tracking app (like Flo or Clue) to export your data
- Upload it to MoonRiver website through a secure portal
- Your data is encrypted and anonymous—no one can trace it back to you.

### 🔒 We Check and Protect Your Data

- Your data is double-checked for accuracy and uniqueness by Validators using TEE
- A special process makes sure your data hasn't been tampered with

### 🔬 Your Data Helps Research

- Once your data is approved, it goes into a pool that researchers and companies can access
- They pay to use the data.

### 💰 You Get Paid

- Every time someone uses your data, you earn rewards in Moonlight (MOON) tokens
- You can trade, use, or save them.

## 🌸 Proof of Contribution Process for Women's Menstruation Data

To ensure authenticity, contributors upload menstruation tracking data exports from apps like Clue or Flo. 📱 Validators verify the data by comparing its checksum to the checksum provided by the app’s official download mechanism, ensuring no tampering has occurred. Ownership is confirmed through metadata linking the data to the user’s app account, or through simplified methods like email or in-app verification. 

The quality of the data is assessed based on completeness, consistency, and relevance, ensuring it includes meaningful metrics like cycle dates, symptoms, and health indicators. A unique fingerprinting process prevents duplicates by comparing submissions to existing datasets. If a submission is too similar to previously submitted data, it is flagged and rejected. This streamlined process ensures contributions are authentic, unique, and valuable while maintaining user privacy and data integrity.
