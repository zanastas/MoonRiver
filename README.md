# Moon River - A Period Data Pool for Better Women's Health

Moon River is a Data Liquidity Pool (DLP) built on Vana, a layer-one blockchain designed for the trustless and secure exchange of user-owned data.

Problem
Women's health—especially menstrual health—hasn't been properly studied. There's not enough good quality data about periods, symptoms, and related health issues. This makes it harder to create better treatments and tools for women's health.

Our Solution
We create a safe, private, and rewarding space where women can share their period-related data (e.g. tracking symptoms, cycle patterns, or birth control side effects). This data helps researchers and AI companies create better models, tools and treatments for menstrual health, and contributors get paid every time their data is used.

How It Works
