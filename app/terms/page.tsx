              <strong>(c) Testnet Tokens No Monetary Value:</strong> Within the
              scope of your engagement with the Testnet, you may amass “testnet
              tokens”. You agree and acknowledge that these tokens neither
              possess nor will they ever transform into or accumulate to become
              mainnet tokens or any other form of tokens or virtual assets.
              Testnet tokens are purely virtual entities devoid of any monetary
              significance. They do not represent any form of currency or
              tangible asset and cannot be exchanged, reimbursed, or converted
              into any fiat or virtual currency or any item of value.
              Transferring Testnet tokens between users outside the Testnet is
              prohibited, and any endeavors to sell, barter, or relocate any
              Testnet tokens beyond the Testnet confines, or to secure any form
              of credit leveraging Testnet tokens, are strictly forbidden. Any
              such attempts shall be deemed null and void. Vana retains the
              exclusive right to erase, purge, or otherwise eliminate the
              Testnet at any juncture without prior notification. This includes,
              but is not limited to, altering the existence, quantities, or any
              stipulations related to the Testnet tokens, all without incurring
              any liability towards you or other Testnet participants. Vana
              offers no assurance regarding the sustained provision of Testnet
              tokens for any predetermined duration, and you are cautioned
              against anticipating their perpetual availability. Should the
              Testnet be discontinued or terminated, you recognize and consent
              to the cessation of your access to and utilization of your Testnet
              tokens, and erasure of all accumulated Testnet tokens from the
              Testnet infrastructure. Under no circumstances will Testnet tokens
              be transmuted into any prospective rewards offered by Vana.

              associated with your participation in Testnet. Vana expressly

              mainnet, or in the course of disbursing incentives/rewards, Vana
              may transmit or receive Testnet tokens or rewards to your
              designated wallet application. In such instances, you are
              exclusively accountable for the safeguarding and management of the

          <strong>(b) Agreement to Arbitrate:</strong> This Dispute Resolution

          out of or relating to this Agreement (including any alleged breach
          thereof), the Testnet, and any aspect of the relationship or
          transactions between us, shall be resolved exclusively through final
          and binding arbitration, rather than a court, in accordance with the
          terms of this Arbitration Agreement, except that you may assert
          individual claims in small claims court, if your claims qualify.
          Further, this Arbitration Agreement does not preclude you from
          bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies,
          and such agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on
          your behalf. You agree that, by entering into this Agreement, you and
          Vana are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate
          in a class action. Your rights will be determined by a neutral
          arbitrator, not a judge or jury.

          <strong>(d) Pre-Arbitration Dispute Resolution:</strong> Vana is
          always interested in resolving disputes amicably and efficiently, and
          most user concerns can be resolved quickly and to the user’s
          satisfaction by emailing support at hello@vana.com. If such efforts
          prove unsuccessful, a party who intends to seek arbitration must first
          send to the other, by certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute
          (“Notice”). The Notice to Vana should be sent to 548 Market St, PMB
          77861, San Francisco, CA 94104 (“Notice Address”). The Notice must (i)
          describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute and (ii) set
          forth the specific relief sought. If Vana and you do not resolve the
          claim within sixty (60) calendar days after the Notice is received,
          you or Vana may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the
          arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by Vana or you
          shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator
          determines the amount, if any, to which you or Vana is entitled.

          <strong>(e) Arbitration Procedures:</strong> Arbitration will be
          conducted by a neutral arbitrator in accordance with the Cayman
          International Mediation and Arbitration Centre’s (“CIMAC”) rules and
          procedures (collectively, the “CIMAC Rules”), as modified by this
          Arbitration Agreement. If there is any inconsistency between any term
          of the CIMAC Rules and any term of this Arbitration Agreement, the
          applicable terms of this Arbitration Agreement will control unless the
          arbitrator determines that the application of the inconsistent
          Arbitration Agreement terms would not result in a fundamentally fair
          arbitration. The arbitrator must also follow the provisions of this
          Agreement as a court would. All issues are for the arbitrator to
          decide, including, but not limited to, issues relating to the scope,
          enforceability, and arbitrability of this Arbitration Agreement.
          Although arbitration proceedings are usually simpler and more
          streamlined than trials and other judicial proceedings, the arbitrator
          can award the same damages and relief on an individual basis that a
          court can award to an individual under this Agreement and applicable
          law. Decisions by the arbitrator are enforceable in court and may be
          overturned by a court only for very limited reasons. Unless Vana and
          you agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in a
          reasonably convenient location for both parties with due consideration
          of their ability to travel and other pertinent circumstances. If the
          parties are unable to agree on a location, the determination shall be
          made by the CIMAC.

          <strong>(f) Costs of Arbitration:</strong> Payment of all filing,
          administration, and arbitrator fees (collectively, the “Arbitration
          Fees”) will be governed by the CIMAC Rules, unless otherwise provided
          in this Arbitration Agreement. If the value of the relief sought is
          $75,000 or less, at your request, Vana will pay all Arbitration Fees.
          If the value of relief sought is more than $75,000 and you are able to
          demonstrate to the arbitrator that you are economically unable to pay
          your portion of the Arbitration Fees or if the arbitrator otherwise
          determines for any reason that you should not be required to pay your
          portion of the Arbitration Fees, Vana will pay your portion of such
          fees. In addition, if you demonstrate to the arbitrator that the costs
          of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of
          litigation, Vana will pay as much of the Arbitration Fees as the
          arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being
          cost-prohibitive. Any payment of attorneys’ fees will be governed by
          the CIMAC Rules.

          provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and
          that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or
          unenforceable term or provision, and this Arbitration Agreement shall
          be enforceable as so modified. If a court or the arbitrator decides
          that any of the provisions of subsection (c) above titled “Prohibition
          of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief” are
          invalid or unenforceable, then the entirety of this Arbitration
          Agreement shall be null and void, unless such provisions are deemed to
          be invalid or unenforceable solely with respect to claims for public

              <strong>(e) No Waiver:</strong> Vana’s failure to enforce any
              right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver
              of such right or provision. The waiver of any such right or
              provision will be effective only if in writing and signed by a
              duly authorized representative of Vana. Except as expressly set
              forth in these Terms, the exercise by either party of any of its
              remedies under these Terms will be without prejudice to its other
              remedies under these Terms or otherwise.
